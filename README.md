# Installation

1. Make sure you've installed all requirements
2. Clone this repository:  
  `git clone https://github.com/[username]/[repository]`
3. Install dependencies using `npm`:  
  `npm i`
4. Fetch the `Rocket.Chat.Docs` source files, into a `src` directory:  
  `gulp fetch`
5. Compile assets and serve the transformed pages locally:
  `gulp`

It will also create a `build` directory with the static pages.

# Workflow

1. Make edits to the files in `src` directory
2. metalsmith will *hot reload* and compile your changes
3. Test using a browser 
4. Repeat 1 if required
5. `git push` the tested final changes back to `Rocket.Chat.Docs`

# Requirements

* Gulp (`npm i -g gulp-cli`)

## Note

If you are adding files or directories to the docs, the *hot reload* will not see those files/directories until you restart `gulp`.
